 > Speckle is the first AEC data hub that connects with your favorite AEC tools. Speckle exists to overcome the challenges of working in a fragmented industry where communication, creative workflows, and the exchange of data are often hindered by siloed software and processes. It is here to make the industry better.

# Repo structure

This repo is the home of our next-generation Speckle .NET SDK. It uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS.

- **SDK**
  - [`Speckle.Sdk`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/src/Speckle.Sdk): Send/Receive operations, Serialization, API wrappers, and more!.
  - [`Speckle.Sdk.Dependencies`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/src/Speckle.Sdk.Dependencies): Dependencies and code that shouldn't cause conflicts in Host Apps.  This uses [IL Repack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) to merge together and interalized only to be used by Speckle.
  - [`Speckle.Automate.Sdk`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/src/Speckle.Automate.Sdk): .NET SDK for [Speckle Automate](https://www.speckle.systems/product/automate)

# Developing and Debugging

### Building

Ensure you're using a [8.0.4xx](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) .NET SDK. 
After cloning this repository, just restore all the NuGet packages and hit Build!

### Developing

It is highly recommended you use
 - Either Jetbrains Rider or Visual Studio 2022
 - Ensure your IDE is set to use [the correct .NET SDK version](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/blob/main/global.json) (newer major versions may work, but may incorrectly run analysers we haven't configured)
 - You should install the cshapier plugin ([Rider](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18243-csharpier), [VS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.CSharpier)) and configure it to run on save

Docs are a bit patchy [https://docs.speckle.systems/developers/looking-for-developer-docs](https://docs.speckle.systems/developers/looking-for-developer-docs)

### Tests

There are several test projects. It is a requirement that all tests pass for PRs to be merged.

The Integration test projects require a local server to be running.
You must have docker installed. Then you can run `docker compose up` from the root of the repo to start the required containers.

In CI, they will be run against both the public and private versions of the server.
It is important that we remain compatible with both server versions.
