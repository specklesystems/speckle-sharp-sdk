- **SDK**
  - [`Speckle.Sdk`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/src/Speckle.Sdk): Transports, serialization, API wrappers, and logging.
- **Speckle Objects**
  - [`Speckle.Objects`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/src/Speckle.Objects): The Speckle Objects classes used for conversions.
- **Tests**
  - [`Tests`](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk/tree/dev/tests): Unit, serialization, integration, and performance tests.

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

# Developing and Debugging

### Building

Make sure you clone this repository together with its submodules: `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp-sdk.git -recursive`.
Afterwards, just restore all the NuGet packages and hit Build!

### Developing

This project is evolving fast, to better understand how to use Core we suggest checking out the Unit and Integration tests. Running the integration tests locally requires a local server running on your computer.

We'll be also adding [preliminary documentation on our forum](https://discourse.speckle.works/c/speckle-insider/10).

### Tests

There are two test projects, one for unit tests and one for integration tests. The latter needs a server running locally in order to run.
